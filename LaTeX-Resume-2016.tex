I am seeking an electrical engineering internship for the summer of 2017.
Currently, I am a student at Colorado State University, majoring in Electrical
Engineering.

As an electrical engineering student, I can add insight and value to any project
I may work on. In addition to my course work, I work part-time at the College
of Engineering for Engineering Network Services. As a lab technician, I have
learned how to work as part of a team to complete both individual and group
projects.

I am self motivated and desire to learn new things. I taught myself how to
program and hook up Arduinos and other micro-controllers well before I would
have learned this in college. I also built an 1.5 ft x 2.5 ft remote controlled
car out of a desire to understand motor controllers and remote control and
battery technology.

You will find more information about my education and experience in my attached
resum√©. I am happy to supply you with any completed coursework, list of job
duties, references or other documents if needed.

Thank you very much for considering me for an internship. I look forward to
talking with you further.
