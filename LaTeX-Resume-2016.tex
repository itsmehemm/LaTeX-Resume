%I am writing to apply for your Energy Engineering Internship Program as listed on your website. Siemens has a reputation for producing innovative products and solutions in the energy industry and I believe that as an electrical engineering student, I can add insight and value to any project I may work on.
%
%I am working on a Electrical Engineering Bachelors Degree from Colorado State University and believe that this internship would complement my educational experience immensely. I also think that my three years of lighting technician experience at Aurora Fox Arts Center in Denver CO would bring a unique perspective to this internship. During my year of employment at Engineering Network Services, I have learned how to work as part of a team to complete both individual and group projects. 
%
%I am self motivating and desire to learn new things. On my own time I have taught myself how to program and hook up Arduinos and other micro-controllers well before I would have learned this in college. I also have built an 1.5 ft x 2.5 ft remote controlled car out of a desire to understand motor controllers, and remote control and battery technology.
%
%You will find more information about my education and experience in my attached resum\'e. I am happy to supply you with any completed coursework, list of job duties or other documents if needed.
%
%I thank you for considering my application. I am available to talk with you further at your convenience. I will also be attending the fall and spring Engineering Career Fairs at Colorado State University if meeting then would be more convenient.
